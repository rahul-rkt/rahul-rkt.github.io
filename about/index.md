My name is Rahul[<sup><i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i></sup>](http://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Rahul) Kumar[<sup><i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i></sup>](http://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Kumar) Thakur[<sup><i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i></sup>](http://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Thakur).

I am a Masters student at the **[University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk)** (HK). I am studying Computer Science and my final year project is Music Playing on Smartphones. I have covered a variety of topics here and I enjoy working on *Human-Computer Interactions* the most. I like thinking about how something is interacting or behaving in an environment and for applications or computers this is a significant question to answer in my opinion. I have mainly devoted my time here in *Mobile and Web Technologies, User Interface, Machine Learning and Big Data*.

Prior to this, I was working with **[Oracle Financial Services](https://www.oracle.com/industries/financial-services/index.html)** in Mumbai (IN) as an Associate Consultant. I was with the Next Generation Product Development team who were working on the then unreleased *[Oracle Banking Platform](https://www.oracle.com/us/industries/financial-services/banking/banking-platform/index.html)*, which is an end to end solution targeted at tier-1 banks of the world. My main responsibility was to write frameworks to automate common tasks for my team, the major one being *Common Logging Framework*. It provided a generic non-blocking interface to log all third-party communication in and out of the system. It is now being used by all the teams and has become the default framework for its generic nature to accept any kind of Object or XML, parsing and persisting over File or Database. Apart from writing frameworks, I used to do a lot of experimentation with various technologies, testing and finding their applicability in the existing product.

Before even that, I did my Bachelors from **[Bengal Institute of Technology](http://www.bitcollege.org)**, Kolkata (IN). My final year project was on Artificial Intelligence, *The Apple Chess Program*, which is basically an AI I wrote to play the game of Reversi (also known as Othello or Apple Chess). Its core algorithm is a combination of MinMax algorithm running in parallel with NegaMax algorithm for profiling possible move set in the next 5 moves from the current board position. I reduced the total time by using Alpha-Beta to prune non-desired branches, and it generally took around 1.2-1.9 secs. The profiling was also done over the users move to predict the strategy being used and deliver a counteracting move. Apart from classes, I took part in the social aspects of BIT, actively contributing in the Technical and Cultural Fests. I was nominated the *General Secretary* in 2009, being responsible for organising and executing *Impulse â€˜09*.

Well rather than boring you further with my adventures/misadventures at school before that, I am going to end this section here. Thank you.
